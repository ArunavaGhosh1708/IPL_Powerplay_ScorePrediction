# IPL_Powerplay_ScorePrediction

The objective of this project is to utilize Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) implemented within the TensorFlow framework to predict the total score of an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket match at the conclusion of the first six overs. The input dataset comprises various factors, including venue information, details of the batsmen, and bowlers involved during the initial six overs of the match.

To prepare the input data for the ANN model, several data preprocessing techniques were applied. This involved utilizing label encoding to convert categorical variables, such as the stadium, into numerical representations. Additionally, one-hot encoding was employed to handle categorical variables with multiple categories, creating binary features for each category. Furthermore, feature engineering was performed to derive additional informative attributes from the raw data. In order to enhance model efficiency and reduce noise, irrelevant data that did not contribute significantly to the target label was eliminated.

This project addresses a regression problem where the goal is to predict a numeric value, specifically the total score at the end of six overs in an IPL match. The ANN model was trained on the preprocessed data and subsequently evaluated on a validation dataset containing details from the IPL 2021 season. The results demonstrate a commendable level of accuracy, indicating the model's effectiveness in predicting IPL scores.
